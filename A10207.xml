         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For proofe wherof I will appeall to none other but to thyne owne experience. Firſt who ſeeth not that all their Cannons and Decrees both new and ould tend to no other end but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralling of the ſoules and bodyes of Gods people, and the bringing of them under an Antichristian yoke, wich appeares firſt that ſince the yeare 1624. they have changed the oath of Curchwardens and ſidemen (as they call them) into that forme that it is now become nothing ells but a rack for the conſciences of men and may truly be called an injurjous and blooddy oath 2. What elſe is the ground, why they have taken away all thoſe Cannons
<pb facs="tcp:10978:4"/>
that reſpect them ſelues, that the people cannot ſee them, but that they might more peaceably and freely prey on the bodyes and ſoules of men at their owne pleaſures. 3. What is the reaſon they doe of late uſe ſo many ſhiftes and trickes to maintayne their ſtandings as they do by devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the inchrochments upon the liberty of the ſubject, the like whereof cannot beparalelled by robbing of the nobility of their honorus, tytles, offices, and dignityes, and conferring them on their owne heades or the heades of their favorites; yea is it not matter enough (if not a friend to the prelacy) for any (though otherwiſe deſerving never ſo well) to ſtand like a beakon on the top of a hill not reſpected. 4. who ſeeth not, that all the good and wholleſomme lawes of the Common wealth is by them turned upſide downe, &amp; like a leaden wand bowed to every end that ſuits them ſelues, be it right or wrong; thus like horſes are they prepared to battell with ſtrong unreſiſtible power to beare downe all before them that doth but mute against their curſed uſurpations. 5. what ranke or order of men comes not under their tyranny and oppreſſion in their matchles extortions? they ſleight the rich in the height of their pride, they regard not the cryes of the widdow and fatherleſſe, but like men voyd of compaſſion or bereft of humanity wring and wrest from all men in all cauſes abundantly more then is alowed them by their owne Cannons and Eccleſiaſticall lawes; and eſpecially in the probats of wills and adminiſtrations they are as the Proph. Zeph ſaith. 3. 3. Like the evening wolfs that leave not the bones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the morning, my brethre may not the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine againſt us as againſt his owne people. Ier. 5. 26. that among his people are found wicked men that lay wait as he that ſetteth ſnares, they ſet a trap to catch men; as a cage is full of birdes, ſo are their howſes full of deceyt, therfore they are become great &amp; wax rich, alſo they Judg not the cauſe of the fatherleſſe, but as in the 29. ſhall not the Lord viſit for theſe thinges? ſhall not his ſoule be avenged on ſuch a nation as this? Therfore brethren and loving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen conſidering theſe things, let me in a word ſpeak to you all under theſe two ranks, other as you are the called of God, or as yet uncalled by him. And firſt to you that are called of God, let me speak to you in the words of the Lord by the Prophet Ierem. 2. 18. <hi>What have you to doe in the way of Aegypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what haſt thou to doe in the way of Aſſyria, to drink the waters of the river?</hi> Or for the fear of man to bee found in the way of Gilgall, for all their wickednes is in Gilgall, there doth the Lord hate them, and for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quityes wil in his time arive them out of his houſe; therfore come not at their courts, obey not their ſummons ſent out in their own names against

the law of the land and honour of the King, ſo that if the Kings Majeſty were not very patient towards them, and thoſe that ſubmit to their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations where were they? Truſt God with your goods and lives, he is able to recompence all wth better, ad not fire then to this altar of Baal, neither by purſe nor preſence, <hi>Walk not after theſe commaundemens of men leſt Ephraim like, ye he oppreſſed and broken in judgment, and the Lord become to you (as to him) a moth, or as he was to Iudah rottenes, Hoſea</hi> 5. 11. 12. My brethren be not affraid of man in Gods cauſe, conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith to Timothy 2. epiſt. 1. 7. <hi>God hath not given to us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, of love, of a ſound minde,</hi> Where obſerve, this fear of man for the prevailing power therof, is called the spirit of feare, and is oppoſed to the ſpirit of God, as power, and love and a ſound minde, whence then we may learn. That where ever his fear of man is reſiding in the ſtrength and power of it, there no ſound power of godlines, nor ſoundnes of judgment, nor power of action, is to be looked for. Beſides this fear of man will be a ſnare to you, for <hi>the fear of man bringeth a ſnare, but who ſo truſteth in God ſhalbe ſure.</hi> Prov. 29. 25. Beſides there is a lake prepared for the fearfull, ſay not then wth the fainthearted ſpyes, there be giants, and walls up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and we ſhall never overcome, for we overcome in ſufferring. Conſider alſo, that God, the Gospell, and the people of God, are more beholding (if I may ſo ſpeak) to one conſtant ſufferrer ſent of God, then to ten thouſand fainthearted apoſtates and backſliders, therefore my brethren looke what Gods worthyes have done, and doe likewiſe, as Paule to Timo. 2. epiſt. 1. 8. ſo I ſpeak to you all in his words, <hi>Be not you therefore aſhamed of the teſtimonie of our lord, nor of me his priſonner, but be you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the afflictions of the Goſpell, according to the power of God who hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling.</hi>

Or els thou muſt maintain thy right by an inditement at the common ſeſſions of the quarter where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was committed.</hi> Thus in as few words and as punctually as I can I have commended theſe ſmall labours of mine to thee, which I deſire may be to Gods glory and thy direction, and then let God deale wth mee as ſeemeth good in his owne eies.

            <p>OH that my counſell might become acceptable to you all, that you would breake of your offences by repentance, and your crueltyes by mercy to Gods ſaints and people, and that you would leave lording of it over your fellow brethren, let not the Lord when he ſhall come in the cloudes, finde you ſmiting Ieremie on the cheek, leſt Paſhurs portion prove your inheritance, and the Lord make you a terrour to your ſelvs, for know you all for a certain, that your vinyards are moſt ripe to the winepreſſe, and that the Angell wbo hath that ſharp ſickle in his hand, is coming forth to cutt downe all the vines of the vineyards of the earth, and to caſt them into the winepreſſe of the wrath of almighty God, therefore let me again and again intreat you, to leave lording of it over Gods inheritance, and rob not the Kings Majeſty of his maintenaunce; nor the nobility of their titles and dignityes, nor the magiſtrates of their power and authority, nor the ſubjects of their rigths and inheritances, take not the garmente from the widdow, nor the bread from the fatherles by your extortions, eate not up the Lords people like bread any longer, leſt the Lord bring a plague upon you, out of which you ſhall not hee able to pull your necks, let the Lord Chriſts name be honoured and ſett up in all his offices and ordinaunces on Sion his holy mountain, juſſel him no longer out of his Kingly throne; leſt he reckon you among his enemies, and ſo ſlay you all before him, build not up your Syon with bloods, nor your Ieruſalem with crueltyes, leſt you make a fruitfull land become an heap, or a deſolate wildernes, think not by cruelty to ſuppreſſe Gods truth, for rather then it ſhall want witneſſes, God wil make the ſtones to doe it, and ſo raiſe up witneſſes out of the duſt of them, whom you and your forefathers have ſlaine, digge no longer ſo deep to hide your counſells from the Lord, for the Lords knowes, and hath revealed it to his ſaincts; that you are no other, then the very bellowes of Antichrist, by which he blowes up and kindleth that fire of ſuperstition and idolatrye in our Engliſh nation, therefore diſplay no longer the coulours of Antichrist in the

Lords camp, hold no longer up the enſigne ſtaffe of that man of ſin, by which you have ſo long beaten the Lords people, lay down your bucklers now at the length at the Lords feete, that if it he poſsible you may finde mercy; oh hear, hear, and be not proud, leſt your bonds increaſe; let not the ſoules of Gods ſaints (whom you contemne) weep anie longer in ſecret for your pride, be not you a means to cauſe the Lord to forſake his people and to ſuffer his people to be led away captive and to ſing the ſongs of Sion in a strange land, and be not ſo in love with an Italian Lord, as for him to ingage your ſoules, King and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trye; But why doe I thus ſpeake unto you? can a blackemoore change his ſkin?

               <p>For the decree of the Iudge, in diſtributing of goods, amoung the next of kin, &amp; for regiſtring of the ſame 13. ſ. 4. d. but what beſides have beene given, &amp; taken are eaſy to prove, wherby ſome had their portions inlarged ſome diminiſhed at the Iudges pleaſure, or the pleaſure of the regiſter.</p>
               <p>For the fee of a proctor in any cauſe 12. d. but conſtantly taken 3. ſ. 4. as all by experience knowe to be true.</p>
               <p>Thus have I run over all theſe particulars one by one, to this end that the Reader might be informed of their unjuſt proceedings in every particular, wherin I have onely ſhewed thee what is taken by waye of inhaunſed fees. But now give me leave, in a word, to give thee a taſte of their innovated fees, that is of fees taken for which there is no lawe, nor colour of lawe, as alſo to diſcover to thee ſome other of their practiſes, to increaſe their fees, which ſhalbe done very breifly.</p>
               <p>And firſt take notice, they have changed the oath of their church-wardens into that it is now become of the nature of an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition oath, wherby they rack the conſciences of men, &amp; by it doo drawe out of them, ſuch preſentations to their courts, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould not meete withall, and this is done by them ſince the yeare 1624. what it then was, &amp; now is, may at large appeere
<pb facs="tcp:10978:14"/>
by comparing them together, by the new oath they compell men to ſweare, to preſent, all whom they ſuſpect, for want of conformity to any of the articles given them in charge: what the effect of this oath is to them, is playne in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt hereby they meete with ſome tender conſcience, which dare not medle with this oath, &amp; then they muſt buye it of, for their monyes: &amp; hereby greate &amp; large fees comes to them, 2. ly. they meete with ſome alſo, that will not come to this, but will reaſon out the matter with them, theſe they excommunicate, (even to death as it were) if they ſtand it out with them, then a <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificavit,</hi> or els, into the high commiſſion with them, and if there once, what the conſequences wilbe, I ſpare to write, &amp; if they take the oath, &amp; that the yeare comes about, &amp; they preſent no body, then they put him to his oath, upon his former oath, and wil make him to ſweare whether all his pariſh, both miniſter &amp; people doe duly obſerve all the articles given them in charge, &amp; thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, are taintered out upon this rack, therby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, who &amp; what they be, &amp; in what parte they have offended againſt the premiſes, wherby their courts come to be filled with complaints againſt men, for toyes &amp; tryfles. 3ly. If any ſonne of Belyall through malice, envy, or what grounde ſoever, will ſue any ſo ſworne according to the tenour of his oath, for perjury in not preſenting either miniſter or people in neglect of any of theſe devy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed articles given him in charge, he ſhall proceede againſt him, as againſt a perjured perſon, &amp; ſhall have all favour &amp; reſpect among them, with all the ayde they can affoarde them, even to the utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeing of the partye ſo ſued, as myne owne experience hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Fourthly: to the intent this oath might be made the more offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, &amp; offencive to others, they have added divers new articles of late yeares, &amp; by vertue of this oath, doe binde all their church Officers to ſee them executed, &amp; to preſent the neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in which how contrary to the lawes of England, they doe proceede, I leave to be skanned by them who are judiciouſly wyſe.</p>
               <p>And now for their fees, take notice, that as the lawe alowes them not to take any thing for this booke, nor once ſo much as names what ſhould be given for it, they take 12. d. &amp; ſometymes 1. ſ. 4. d.</p>
               <p>Secondly: wheras but one booke ought to be given out for one yeare yet they compell men to take two, at their price.</p>
               <p>Thirdly<hi>:</hi> they compell their officers to paye for their oathes, where nothing is due.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10978:14"/>
Fourthly: they will let no bills paſſe the court, but ſuch as are of their owne making, for which they take 6. d.</p>
               <p>Fiftly<hi>:</hi> theſe bills will not paſſe unles one or other be preſented.</p>
               <p>Sixtly: what ſilencing, &amp; depoſing, excommunicating, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning of Gods people for not conforming to this booke of articles, and how greatly they increaſe their fees therby, and what ſumme, &amp; ſummes of monyes are daylie brought into their treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therby, is eaſy for all to underſtand.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly: to the end that they may freely preye upon the bodyes &amp; goods of men, &amp; houlde men in bondage to them ſelves, they have taken out all theſe articles out of the booke which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their owne behaviour, &amp; might any waye tend to the benefit of the ſubject, as may appeare at large, by comparing their bookes now, with their bookes for the yeare 1624.</p>
               <p>Eightly: wheras they ſhould maintaine a table of the rates of all fees in every office of the court, that all whom it concerns might come to take a copy of it, they have of purpoſe taken it away, and doe perſecute them to death (as it were) that doe call for it. ſee <hi>Cannon</hi> 136.</p>
               <p>Ninthly<hi>:</hi> what fees are dayly given, &amp; taken for graunting of adminiſtrations to this man: and not an other, yea ſomtymes to the unlawfull party, is not all together unknowen, which practiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this two foulde effect: it ſomtymes depoſeth the lawfull heyre of his inheritance, or ſecondly cauſeth unneceſſary &amp; endles ſuits in their owne courtes, even to the undoeing of many a mans eſtate, thus as a cage is full of birds, ſo are their howſes full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte.</p>
               <p>Tenthly: what other devices to get monyes, they have, may appeere in their delaying &amp; protractinge cauſes, continuances of ſuits upon ſuits, demurrings, ſome of their proctors offering, that for ſo much by the yeare, as he ſhall agree for, with the partye whoſe cauſe is bad, he will hould the oppoſite party from tryall 7. yeares, do what he can, and at laſt, force him to agree for halfe his right.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly: To the end that ſtrength may be in the hand of the oppreſſor, end none to deliver the oppreſſed, nor no place left for the innocent to eſcape, they have made them ſelves maſters of the hygh commiſſion houſe, that if any doe but mute againſt theire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings they get him thither, &amp; then he is gone, either he muſt flie,
<pb facs="tcp:10978:15"/>
or els ſpend his eſtate, conſcience &amp; all, or to their new erected pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to Newgate, Colehowſe, the Clincke, or the Counter muſt be his dwelling, one of theſe he cannot avoyd.</p>
               <p>Good Reader, if I ſhould relate all the cariages in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and purgations, changes of pennance &amp; the like, I ſhould both weary thee, &amp; my ſelfe too, what devices &amp; turnings of things about there is, I leave to thy owne experience to obſerue, &amp; what ſummes of monyes are taken for theſe things, were intollerable to relate, &amp; alſo their devices to bring men on bare crymes without proofe, and what is daylie payd among them, in theſe cauſes, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhewes the truth of. For probats of wills, &amp; adminiſtrations, I have ſhewed before. I will now procede to ſhew their ſinfull abuſe of that ſentence of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them, which yet is the only weapon they fight withall, by which not a litle profit &amp; gayne, doth day lie acrew to them &amp; their depending officers, and by which they hould mens ſoules in tyrannicall bondage, &amp; by which they hooke not a litle profit to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves, making it the very ſnare &amp; ginne to catch men, as experience proves, every man being ſo daunted at it, as if inded what they ſo ſinfully doe, were ratyfied in heaven, in which for thy better information, I will open theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I will ſhew what this cenſure is according to the ordinance of Chriſt, in the Goſpel.</item>

                  <item>6. How it differs from this cenſure now in uſe among us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, we muſt know that this cenſure is a ſolemne &amp; fearfull, &amp; powerfull cenſure of the church, cutting-off lawfully, &amp; according to Gods word, caſting out of their publik ſocyety, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent followſhip, all ſuch as publikly offend in ſome greivous cryme, or be obſtinat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temners of the lawfull admonitions of the church for private faults, that by ſuch ſhame they may be drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and others by their example be kept from the infection of ſin, &amp; is warranted by theſe ſcript. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. 6. 7. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>2. For the Authour, it was no other but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe lawes &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are all unchangable by man, &amp; to be kept pure &amp; unrebukable, till the apearing of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as appeares by that 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. where
<pb facs="tcp:10978:15"/>
an expreſſe commaund is given to tell the church.</p>
               <p>3. The ende for which it was ordayned, was three fould<hi>:</hi> firſt, in reſpect of the party offending it is for the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, that the ſoule may be ſaved in the daye of the Lord 1. Cor. 5. 5. Secondly in regarde of others, that by their example, they may learne not to blaſpheme. 1 Tim. 1. 20. Thirdly: in regard of the whole body of the church, that they may be purged from the old leaven of ſinne, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears 1. Cor. 5. 8. and theſe are the ends, &amp; no private reſpect.</p>
               <p>4. The benefite of theſe ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in the church, appeares by this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By theſe ordinances, the ſuperfluous members of the church, are kept from hurting and annoying the reſt of the body, for it is Gods pruning knife, wherby he cutts off every branch in his vyne, that bringeth not forth good fruite, that ſo thoſe which doe bring forth ſome fruit may be purged, to the end they may bring forth more fruit Iohn. 15. Secondly: hereby are kept out all thoſe that are openly diſcovered to be profane and wicked, from pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ordinances of God: by it the wicked, &amp; ſinne it ſelfe, is greatly ſtopped in their courſe, yea this is yet more, the church is terrible to the wicked, as an armye with banners, for this ordinance of God, being in the right uſe of it, is as terrible as death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby is it, Gods Church is fenced (as with a wall) that the wild boore out of the forreſt, &amp; the foxes that deſtroy the vines, cannot enter, or if they doe through their craft, yet by this ordinance of God, the church can be purged of them. Thus Paule purged the church of Hymeneus &amp; Alexander 1. Tim. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſetting up of this ordinaunce in all the parts of it, wold indeed make the church beautifull, &amp; the glory of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d temple, to exceede the firſt: whoſe hart can chooſe then to be affected with the want of ſo uſefull an ordinance as this is. And who can ſee any man running to his owne howſe, letting the Lords houſely waſte &amp; not mourne for it? alas the profane, doe not now as in old, com onely to the outer courte, but into the holyeſt of all, &amp; pollute all the holy things of God therin: but oh the cvill tyme in which we are fallen, in which peace &amp; plenty brings ſecurity, every man running to his owne howſe, &amp; thinking that muſt be builded with hewen ſtones &amp; timber, hewen by the ſkill of the builder, but Gods howſe may be builded with ſtones, as they come out of the rock, or trees as they growe in the foreſt, without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a reſpect at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10978:16"/>
Fiftly, the perſons in whom it reſts are the body of the church being met together in one place, the grave elder being as the mouth of the reſt, in pronounceing of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the difference between this ordinance of Chriſt, and that in uſe among them apeares in theſe things. 1. In regard of the Authour, the one being of Chriſt, the other of Antichriſt: it being the ſame for nature &amp; adminiſtration now, that it was when he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among us, &amp; the ſame now in uſe in his owne kingdome, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be reſpected nor ſubmitted unto by the ſubjects of the kingdome of Chriſt, ſeeing every ſubject ought to be governed by the ſcepter of his owne kinge, &amp; that becauſe he is his kinge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in nature, the owne is divine, &amp; heavenly: the other is ſinfull and wicked, the one is ahe truth of God: the other a lye in the right hands of them that put them forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in the ende of them, one is onely for the gaininge of ſinners, &amp; to purge the church of them<hi>:</hi> the other to gaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, &amp; to Lord over the bodyes, goods, ſoules &amp; conſciences of men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ in the maner of adminiſtration, the one vſed as the laſt meanes for the gaining of a ſinner, when nothing els will, &amp; therfore never uſed, but for ſins duly convicted &amp; obſtinatly ſtood in: the other uſed ſinfully for toyes to get monyes by, &amp; to be as a ſnare or net, to catch men by.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard of the manner, the one is adminiſtred by the body of the church, being met together in one place: the other alone by ſome one man. And by theſe things we may ſee what cauſe men have to feare this cenſure, as if what they ſinfully doe, were confirmed in heaven, &amp; God doth indeed poure ſhame &amp; contempt on them &amp; their Cenſures, for who ſees not all men to eſteeme of it, as it is, for all men ſee it is not the deſtruction of the fleſh, but of the man, &amp; his monyes, that they ſeeke.</p>
               <p>And now to ſpeak one word about the oath by which officers are ſworne, let the oath it ſelf be minded the form wherof here ſtandeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſhall ſweare that you and every of you ſhall duely and diligently inform your ſelves of theſe articles given you in charge, and that all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, hatred, through feare or anie other corrupt affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſet aſide, you ſhall preſent all and every ſuch perſon now or lately of your pariſh, which hath committed anie offence compriſed in anie of theſe articles, or which are</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10978:16"/>
                  <hi>vehemently ſuſpected or defamed of anie ſuch offence, wherin you ſhall deale according to an upright conſcience, neither preſenting, nor sparing to preſent anie perſon contrary to truth, ſo help you God, and his faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How farr this oath is chaunged from that it was in the years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1624. let the reader judge.</p>
               <p>The evills contayned in this oath are briefly theſe. Firſt whereas an oath ought to bee done in righteouſnes, in truth, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is unrighteouſly taken and impoſed, and without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appears in theſe particulars. 1. In that it is not impoſed by a lawfull Magiſtrate. 2. It ſwervs from my allegiance to other lawes beſides the laws of the land, and ſervs to all thoſe inventions that a Lord Biſhop can thruſt into an article booke, which is contrary to the ſtatute of 25. Henry 8. and 1. Elizabeth. Thirdly it binds me to a neceſſity of ſining on one hand or other, either I muſt preſent my neighbour for toyes, yea for mere ſuſpicious without grownd, or breake my oath, and whoever thou art that takeſt it, thou bindſt thyſelfe by this oath to ſubmit thyſelf, and ſo haſt made thyſelf the ſervant of ſinfull man, yea by this oath as an enemy to God, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour of his ſaints, and doſt ſitt under the banner of Antichriſt, in that thou haſt put to thine hand and ſworn with thy mouth to put all ſuch lawes and articles in execution, and purſue thoſe that doe not the ſame, conſider that in theſe words, <hi>ſo help me God</hi> thou doſt call God to witnes thy faithfullnes in theſe things, and doſt invocate his name, that if thou doſt faile to doe according to the tenour of this oath, he would doe ſo to thee, and more likewiſe, that is, bring ſome eminent judgment on thee, conſider theſe things and fear and tremble.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the finiſhing of the table of Fees, and thoſe obſervations of their abuſes, upon my ſhort experience taken, a copy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the hande of a mourner, for ſuch burthens upon his loving Countreymen, was grieved that ſo many and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable abuſes ſhould be ſo briefly paſſed over; whereupon knowing ſomething farther that might diſcover the iniquity of this preſent evill generation, I thought it my duty to ſpare from my own neceſſity, ſome farther charge, for my countries good. Vnto their abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then forementioned, I will ad ſomething of their extortion even in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, pretended for the Churches good, to eaſe burdens, and to reforme abuſes and corruptions, but effecting nothing leſſe, as may eaſily appeare, by comparing theſe times, with the times of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the times of darkneſſe no more procuration might be taken then did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſerve for the expences of the day, whether it were taken in victualls, or in money; neither might the Viſitor, whether he were a Biſhop, Chancellor, or Comiſſary, viſit any more Churches then one in one day; or if he did, yet was he not to take more then one procuration, to the which all Churches ſo met, were to communicate; and this appears to be true from that conſtitution of <hi>Iohn Stradford,</hi> Biſhop of Canterbury; which Procuration is limmited by a decree of <hi>Bennet</hi> the 12. not to exceed the value of So. Turons of ſilver, every 12. Turons making one Florence of pure gold, according to the Engliſh eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, not amounting in coyne the ſumme of five ſhillings at the moſt, for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſubſtitute, and the whole charges for him and his followers, not to exceed 35 s. although he ſhould call forty or fifty, yea a hundred Churches together. And if the Archdeacons ſubſtitute viſite, then not to exceed 12 s. 6 d. and if the Archdeacon viſit perſonally himſelf, then he was to have 20 s. And if the Biſhop viſit himſelf, then he was to have for himſelf and his reteiners 5. marks onely; and none of them to take more, although they ſhould viſit an hundred Churches in one day. And theſe have alſo been mittigated ſince, as being thought too much, by a Provinciall conſtitution in <hi>Linwood,</hi> whereby an Archdeacon is allowed for one dayes diet for himſelf and his followers, but 3 s. 4 d. which (as the gloſſe ſaith) ſeemed to ſuffice foure perſons, and their horſes, with one Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
<pb facs="tcp:10978:18"/>
for one day. But now if they be compared to theſe times, wee ſhall ſee them to exceed in their procurations at their viſitations, as they do in other things; witneſſe their extraordinary pomp, gluttony, I had almoſt ſaid, their drunkenneſſe too; but if I had, I could make it good on ſome of them whom I have known: but their exceſſe is known to all, they drink wine in bowls, and rejoycing when they have robbed ſome Churches for their inordinate expences. Beſides, what ſums of money are taken and carried away by them, is eaſie to be proved, and what tricks they will have to increaſe their fees for every toy, appears by one example known to the world, in which they excommunicated the Churchwardens of T. becauſe they had not finiſhed the repairing of the Church in their yeare, and would not abſolve them without paying an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſumme of monies. If I ſhould repeat all their extortion in this kinde, I might make a volume of complaints.</p>
            <p>But to leave theſe great maſter-Theeves, whoſe daily oppreſſion all ſorts grone under, yet none daring to reprove them, leſt he be reputed as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes the Prieſt, and ſo accounted as an enemy to the Church, and an oppoſer of the Kings Prerogative, when as in truth it is themſelves that are both enemies to the Church, and prejudicious to the Kings Prerogative; for although they pretend to uphold the Kings Prerogative, yet it is their owne they ſeeke indeed, that they may live like princes in the Common wealth; neither, if the thing be duly ſearched into, will it be found they exerciſe any other power, then what was received from the Pope, in the daies and times of darkneſſe, now contrary to the laws of the land, which may appeare by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>1 In that all their citations, ſummons, actions, proceedings, ſentences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and judgements in all cauſes and controverſies determinable before any of them, are begun, continued, and ended in their own names, titles, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, without any relation or mention of authority given to them from the King, but as they formerly had their power from the Pope, ſo doe they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this power and juriſdiction by Popiſh conſtitutions and cuſtoms, and by vertue therof challenge power and right ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>2. This appeares to be true, from that ſtatute of 28. H. 8. which ſtatute being the rule of our Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other the like Officers, with all their uſhering ceremonies, ſhews plainly that they are the ſame they were in the dayes of darknes, and ſo contrary to the Laws of God and the King, yea even to the ſame act in the true meaning of it, as all, who will, may ſee to be moſt plaine, for firſt the King, Peers, and commons, being at this time not inſtructed in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfullnes of the Prelacy and their uſhering ceremonies, did not onely not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abridge anie of their former rights and Priviledges, but gave them power to exerciſe them as before, ſo they were not contrary to the word of God, and the Laws of the Land, now the Prelates being cunning Politicians, and knowing what great revenues came into them, and to the holy Father the Pope, made uſe of their ignorance and the Kings clemency, and ſo continued all, or ſo manie

Now when the Popes lawes are thus executed by them, doth it not declare them to be Subjects of his Kingdome.. 2. The Laws of the Land and ſo of the King are they not all ſnapped in peeces by them? what Law can ſtand before them if they take-in with the offender? Thirdly, if they doe fine anie (as they doe manie not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without but againſt law) under pretence for the King, doe they not preferre one or other of their favourites to beg the fyne of the King, and ſo he is never the better for it. But if it were graunted that they ſtand by the King, yet why ſhould they execute theſe Laws among us, ſeeing they doe us no good, but hurt and annoy us, and are needles and burdenous, and I would to God both they and all their traſh were footles too. 3.

            <p>Now before I conclude I deſire to propound theſe things following to the ſereous conſideration of the judicions godly wiſe. 1. Whether anie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtyes ſubjects ſtand bound by anie act of Parliament to ſubmitt to anie new conſtitutions made by them, and whether they be compellable therunto by lawe, or in pain of excommunication for their neglect?</p>
            <p>2 Whether it be lawfull for anie to exerciſe an abſolute power of them ſelves within his Majeſtyes Dominions or not? and if anie ſo doe, whether they be not under the ſtatute of <hi>premunire,</hi> and whether the prelacy doe not exerciſe ſuch a power?</p>
            <p>3 Whether it be lawfull for anie Biſhop or Archbiſhop or anie other bearing or exerciſing eccleſiaſticall power, to bring anie of his Majeſtyes leige people into inquiſition, ſifting them by oaths to force them to accuſe themſelves, or others for want of conformity in anie of their injunctions, eſpecially when they live in conformity to all his Majeſtyes poſitive lawes.</p>
            <p>4. Whether anie of them have a prerogative above his majeſtyes ſtatute lawes now in force to exact and take of his majeſtyes ſubjects more or leſſe fees then is allowed them by lawe.</p>

ſubjects, yea ſo violent and cruell are theſe unreaſonable men, that they are impatient to ſee anie to live by them, that are not more zealous Ceremoniou of their ſtates and traditions, then truely zealous faithfull orthodoxall, both preachers and people. as if they envyed the image of God in anie, witnes their conſtant perſecuting of the Saints in all places where theire power extends, and that in moſt ſavage manner, I could ſpeake much of their cruell injuſtice to my ſelfe, but let that paſſe, conſidering my owne weaknes and meannes could little benefitt anie, yet it ſhewes their thirſt for bloud, who will not ſpare pains and coſt to catch a flea, yet ſince their crueltye ceaſſeth not to ſilence the Lords worthyes, that they ſay to the Seers ſee not, yea inhumanely hale them out, whiles preſſed under the Lords hand of viſitation, unmercifully pill them by their purſuivants, fine them againſt lawe and equity to the impoveriſhing of them and theirs, even after they have ſuſpended, ſilenced, and excommunicated them, deprived them of all benefitt, yet as if all this were too little, and that for no offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (unles it be offence to looke upon them, yet we ſay <hi>a Catt may looke on a King)</hi> the Purſuivants muſt take them, and carry them to priſon, or take bond to appear at the High Commiſſion, who have their Inquiſition which will ſoone ſift men either of their goods or goodnes. To avoid this ſnare, alas whither would not poore men, that knowe them, runne? For better to looſe much, then goods and liberty and all, I could inſtance a couple of famous preachers, my neighbours, who by the hard meaſure of the Biſhop of London (that outward demure ſheeplike Prelate, but inward ravening wolfe) were chaſed to theſe parts, the one onely for coming into a Church where the Biſhop was viſitting after their Religious exerciſes were ended to ſpeak with a freind, but becauſe he ſtood excommunicate, he might not tread upon holy clodd, but the purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt take him, and carry him away, and no intreaty of anie, nor ſincere and deep proteſtation of the party, could prevaile for his releaſe, but he muſt putt in bond to appeare at the high Commiſſion, and what better there expected, but utter undoing.</p>
            <p>The other was inhumanely handled for preaching one Lords day after he was ſuſpened, although it was without the Liberty of the Biſhop of London, yet he and two others his like, can at the private pleaſures make a Commiſſion, and pack out as manie purſuivants, to make a prey of the afflicted, or Saule-like to bring him bed and all that they may ad the worſt they can to the poore afflicted members of Chriſts body. What Bonner or Story of more cruell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? Let the reader underſtand I preſume to give theſe two inſtances without either of the preachers privity, and therefore it is doubtles too ſhort to expreſſe the haynouſnes of the Prelates extream cruelty towards either of them.</p>
